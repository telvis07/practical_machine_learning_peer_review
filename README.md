- [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises Data](http://telvis07.github.io/practical_machine_learning_peer_review/) : In this project, we use R to build a classifier using the sensor data. The data consists of training set containing over 19000 samples, each with 152 variables and classe outcome variable with the value ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’ or ‘E’. The testing set consists of 20 samples without the classe outcome variable. The goal is to build a classifier using the training data to predict the classe of the testing data.
